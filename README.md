# zh-eth

# Getting Started #
Install truffle `npm install -g truffle`
Install Ganache. https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache
Install Web3 `npm install -g web3`

Start Ganache, choosing quickstart is fine.

The zh-eth configuration assumes 127.0.0.1:7545 with network 5777.  You can configure your Ganache the same way easily.

```
git clone https://github.com/czema/zh-eth
cd zh-eth
npm install
npm run deploy
truffle console
```

As Convex is to Curve we are going to be to Ellipsis.  Allow people to stake EPS tokens for zhEPS tokens which pay out continually.
